# Basics

## What is GO?

* Go is a Compiled, Garbage-collected, and Concurrent language
* Garbage-collection is latency free, unlike Java.
* It is a systems level language like C. But it is built to make use of modern architecture, especially multi-core.
* It is statically typed, but retains the ease of use like dynamic language.
* It is type-safe and memory-safe. Memory safefy means you can set a pointer or overflowing beyond allocated memory.

## What is not there in GO?
* There is no inheritance (Because composition is better). 
* There are no generics (or templates).
* There are no assertions.
* There is no method overloading (thus making compilation process be simple and fast).
